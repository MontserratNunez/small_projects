# small_projects
This repository hosts a collection of small web programming projects. Each project is independent and not related to the others. This allows to explore and experiment with various web development concepts and technologies in isolation.

## Contents
- **Varied Projects**: Includes small web applications, scripts, and tools using different web technologies.

- **Independence**: Each project is designed to function autonomously, so you can work with them individually without concerns about interdependencies.

## Notes
Documentation for each project is located in its own directory.
